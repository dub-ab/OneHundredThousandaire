# One Hundred Thousandaire
A Python Action Scroller Simulation

In this simulation you race time to see how quickly you can amass $100,000.00. 

There are 7 tasks each with a different speed at which it completes as well as a different value returned upon completion.  
Tasks are started by clicking the oval icon.  Watch the progress of the task with it's progress bar.  
(Tip: Keep as many tasks running as possible)

Each task has three options:

  - You can buy more task value so that each time the task completes, you gain the new value. 
    (Tip: Use the mouse wheel to quickly "scroll" through large purchases)
  - You can buy a task automation manager.  The manager will automatically start each task without you having to click the oval icon.
  - You can buy a task speed multiplier.  Each purchase will increase the task speed by 10%.
